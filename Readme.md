## Introduction

Diffusion models are a class of generative models that leverage the concept of iteratively refining a data distribution through a series of diffusion steps. This repository demonstrates your efforts to implement these models using PyTorch, providing a deeper understanding of their inner workings and capabilities. üí°

## Getting Started

Before diving into the code and experiments, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python (3.6+)
- PyTorch (1.6+)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for visualization, optional)
- Jupyter Notebook (for running examples, optional)

To clone this repository, use the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/diffusion-from-scratch.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd diffusion-from-scratch
```

## Implementation Details

This section provides an overview of the key components and techniques used in your implementation of diffusion models from scratch:

- **Diffusion Process**: Explain the concept of diffusion in generative modeling and how it is implemented in your code.

- **Loss Functions**: Describe the loss functions used for training the model, such as the negative log-likelihood loss.

- **Architecture**: Provide details on the neural network architecture(s) used in your implementation, including the number of layers, activation functions, and any other relevant architectural choices.

- **Training Procedure**: Outline the training procedure, including optimizer choices, learning rate schedules, and any data augmentation or preprocessing steps.

## Usage

To use the diffusion models implemented in this repository, follow these steps:

1. **Training**: Train your diffusion model on your dataset of choice. Provide clear instructions and example commands for training.

2. **Generation**: Demonstrate how to generate samples from the trained model. Include code examples and explanations of the parameters to adjust.

3. **Evaluation**: Discuss how to evaluate the quality of generated samples, such as using quantitative metrics or visual inspection.

## Results

In this section, showcase the results and performance of your diffusion models. Include generated samples, comparison with other generative models if applicable, and any quantitative evaluation results. Visualizations and plots can be especially helpful for conveying your findings. üìà
